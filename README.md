This workshop is intended for anyone with a basic understanding of web mapping who wishes to expand their skill set and design more customizable maps. There are 3 main sections: an introduction to Mapbox and its products, a guided developer environment set-up, and a hands-on portion where we will modify given code to design an interactive map powered by Mapbox.
