# What is Mapbox?
[Mapbox](Mapbox.com) is a robust geospatial software as a service (saas) for developers, and includes products such as toolkits for mobile app development, navigation, web maps, and data management. Mapbox's service model is based on a paid subscription, but they offer a free service tier for those interested in using their products for learning which is where we'll start today. If this is your first time hearing about Mapbox, [How Mapbox Works](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/getting-started/) is a great place to begin.



## Mapbox Services

### Mapbox JS Classic 
Mapbox JS Classic is the classic JS library based on Leaflet.js. This product is no longer being actively developed, but is still a good resource for learning, especially the examples.

### MapboxGL JS 
[MapboxGL JS is](https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-gljs) the vector tile framework replacing the classic JS. Examples of use are immensely helpful for tinkering to understand how it works. 

### Mapbox Studio
For those interested in customizing data and tiles, Mapbox Studio is for you. The Studio Manual is a starting point for learning, and so are the how-to videos.

### Navigation SKD and Maps SDK
Mobile app developers may find the Navigation SDK (for iOS, and Android), and [Maps](https://www.mapbox.com/maps) SDK (for iOS, Andriod, and Unity) most useful.

### Application Programming Interfaces (APIs)
Mapbox also provides APIs for programmatic access to their maps, navigation, and geocoding services.
