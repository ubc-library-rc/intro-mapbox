# Setting up a Developer Environment
In order to write the code that builds and renders your web maps you need a few things.

1. First and foremost, you'll need access to internet connection and a computer with an internet browser installed. Recent versions of [Mozilla Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org) and [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) are the recommended browsers. __Note: this workshop requires that you download software from the internet onto your computer. If you are using a computer that is **not** your personal device, make sure you have permission to make such changes and are able to delete them when done.__ 
2. To work with mapbox you must [sign up](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) for a free account and (create an access token)[https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/]. <!--we could have a dummy acct with already generated access tokens if someone doesnt want to create their own or have credit card info on them-->
3. Downloading the Mapbox GL JS graphics library requires running one simple command in your computer's terminal. If you have never worked in the terminal, consider browsing the Research Common's introductory workshop [here](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/intro-shell/content/01-what-is-the-shell.html). <!--see if theres anything else that must be downloaded first -- eg leaflet) --> 
4. Lastly, if you haven't already, you should download a [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor) for swift and efficient map construction.
