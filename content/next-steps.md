# Next Steps
If this workshop has inspired you to expand your skills, try making another map on your own using data for a different location. This will give you some clarity around where you might have some gaps in understanding. Remember, you can create your own GeoJSON with free tools like [geojson.io](geojson.io).

## Plugins and Tutorials 
Exploring Mapbox [Tutorials](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/?product=Mapbox+GL+JS) and [Plugins](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/plugins/) is an excellent way to build on the skills learned in this workshop. With Mapbox GL JS you can [Show changes over time](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/show-changes-over-time/), [Build a store locator](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/building-a-store-locator/), and even work towards building [navigation applications](https://docs.mapbox.com/help/tutorials/route-finder-with-turf-mapbox-directions/). You can also go back and explore the other Mapbox products we didn't cover today. If you create a cool map, feel welcome to share with fellow mappers in [UBC's GIS Slack](https://ubcgis.slack.com/)!
