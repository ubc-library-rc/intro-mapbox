start off with boilerplate basemap

add navigation controls 


map onload function --> everything inside this function will render. 1) add source 2) add layers

add source (right now only works when source is local)

explain cluster option and zooms

add circle layer; explain steps -- copy paste this one
for symbology - participants can pick hex code for color 

add point count to cluster


display unclustered points when zoomed in sufficiently

add pop ups to unclustered points on click with properties, such as name etc.
