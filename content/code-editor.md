## Code Editor 

To make your life easier while viewing or editing code, it's good to use a [source code editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code_editor). This workshop uses (Visual Studio Code)[https://code.visualstudio.com/download] for screenshots, but other editors like [Atom](https://atom.io/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), or [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) will work similarly.
