## Create a Mapbox Account 
Mapbox's service model is based on a paid subscription, but they offer a free service tier for those interested in using their products for learning, with enough resources to get you started. Use of services is authorized on a user-basis by an access token. 

### Access Token 
[Sign up](https://account.mapbox.com/auth/signup/) for a free Mapbox account using an email address you have access to (you will be asked to verify your email). 

### Access Token 
[Create access token](https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/) by giving it a name (like mapbox-workshop) and scrolling to the end of the page where a button says **Create Token**. You will be prompted to confirm your site password. A new access token should appear under the default access token. Keep this browser window open as we will need the access token in a moment.
