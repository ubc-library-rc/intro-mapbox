## Note: this workshop is in development and not yet complete.

This workshop is intended for anyone with a basic understanding of web mapping who wishes to expand their skillset and design more customizable maps. There are 3 main sections: an introduction to Mapbox and its products, a guided coding environment set-up, and a hands-on where we will modify given code to design an interactive map powered by Mapbox and Leaflet. If you are unfamilliar with Leaflet, we recommend you first checkout our  [Web-mapping with Leaflet workshop](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-leaflet/).
