# Designing web maps with Mapbox 

This workshop is intended for anyone with a basic understanding of web mapping who wishes to expand their skillset and design more customizable maps. There are 3 main sections: an introduction to Mapbox and its products, a guided developer environment set-up, and a hands-on portion where we will modify given code to design an interactive map powered by Mapbox.

## Learning objectives

By the end of this workshop you will:    
    
*1*{: .circle .circle-purple} Understand the advantages of web mapping using Mapbox GL JS    
    
*2*{: .circle .circle-purple} Be familiar with the elements of code that make a web map work    
    
*3*{: .circle .circle-purple} Know how to modify code to customize an interactive map of your own, and    
     
*4*{: .circle .circle-purple} Have the basic skills to pursue further tutorials more focused on your individual research interests or project needs  

    

### Prerequisites
Making maps is hard. And, without practice, working in the web is hard too. If you are unfamiliar with Leaflet, we recommend you checkout our [Web-mapping with Leaflet workshop](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-intro-leaflet/). Additionally, understanding basic cartographic principles and what code is and does will make diving into web mapping easier. Refer to these resources at any time:     

- **Intro level computer programming**. [Matt Adesanya's *A Gentler Introduction to Programming*](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/a-gentler-introduction-to-programming-1f57383a1b2c/) is a great starting point, and will be more than you need for this workshop.   
     
- **Intro level HTML, CSS and JavaScript**. [Sololearn.com offers several courses on these topics and more](https://www.sololearn.com/Courses/), but there are several other educational resources to choose from on the web if you prefer something different. You're not expected to be a pro for this workshop, but understanding these concepts will provide some very useful perspective.    
- **Basic cartographic design concepts**. What is map making without a consideration of cartography? Axis Maps has written a phenomenal [short guide to cartography](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/), and [the web map module](https://www.axismaps.com/guide/web/should-a-map-be-interactive/) is especially relevant.
